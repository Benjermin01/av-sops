## 1. Requesting Engineering Services for a Sales Opportunity

When Engineering Services are required for a Sales Opportunity, the Sales Representative is to create an Opportunity with the Design/Engineer funnel item to include:
- Clear directive of the task for Engineering to accomplish.
- Deadline for results to be delivered back to Sales. (End of day entered)
- Resources to complete the task (drawings and specifications).
- Set Assignee to be the Estimator you would like to complete the task.

### Turnaround Time

- Standard turnaround time: 1 week for Opportunity item tasks.
- For oppotunities requiring quicker turnaround times, the request may be rejected if it conflicts with prior obligations.

### Manager Involvement

- If there are issues that need to be addressed beyond working directly between Sales Representative and Estimator, issue to be escalated to Engineering or Sales Manager for resolution.

## 2. Requesting Engineering services for Project Engineering

To request Project Engineering services, the Project Manager must create a task for the Engineering Manager to assign an Engineer during project initiation.
- Accompany the task with an email to relevant stakeholders (e.g., Estimator, Sales Representative, Site Foreman).
- The Engineering Manager to respond with the assigned Engineer's details within 24 hours.

### Handoff Meeting

Required attendees:
- Project Manager
- Sales Representative
- Engineering Manager
- Assigned Project Engineer

Objectives:
- Review project details.
- Define engineering task(s) and timelines.
- Allow the Project Engineer to provide input and recommendations.

### Coordination and Execution

- Engineering team members follow the outlined plan from the handoff meeting.
- Address unplanned obstacles through coordination.
- Project Managers must make the assigned Project Engineer aware of the schedule for all engineering tasks and related milestones.
- General timeline guidance (varies by project):
  - Commissioning, Factory Acceptance Testing, and Programming: typically about 1 week; coordinate at handoff and adjust as the project progresses.

### Progress Communication

Engineering team members must email the Project Manager and Engineering Manager with updates; daily updates are preferred.

### Line-item Changes

Any line-item changes required by Engineering must be sent to the PM via the standardized Add/Delete Sheet (Excel).

### PR Requests

Standard turnaround time is 1 week but actual timing should be coordinated with the PM on a case-by-case basis when the PM tasks Engineering.

## 3. Requesting Engineering Services for Service Calls

Tasks can be directly assigned to the desired Engineering team member.
- For unresolved issues, the Service Manager may request the Engineering Manager's involvement.

### Recommendations

The Service Manager can ask the Engineering Manager to recommend a suitable team member for assignment if needed.
