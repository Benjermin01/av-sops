# Simplified Engineering Department Standard Operating Processes

Below are the current simplified SOPs for the Engineering Department.

## 1. Opportunities

When engineering services are requested for an opportunity, follow these steps:

### 1.1 Refer to Sales Funnel Process
- When creating the Design/Engineer funnel item, include:
  - Clear directive of the task for Engineering to accomplish.
  - Deadline for results to be delivered back to Sales.
  - Resources to complete the task (drawings and specifications).

### 1.2 Engineering Manager Task Review
- The Engineering Manager will review funnel item tasks before assigning them to a team member.
- Review to be completed within 24 hours.

### 1.3 Engineering Manager Results Review
- The Engineering Manager will review results from assigned team members and pass them to the Sales Representative if they pass review.
- Review to be completed within 24 hours.

### 1.4 Turnaround Time
- Standard time: 1 week for Opportunity item tasks.
- Expedited requests: Sales Representatives must coordinate with the Engineering Manager before assigning items requiring shorter deadlines.
- Extended timelines: Written request for extended timelines is not required.

## 2. Projects

When engineering services are required for a project, follow these steps:

### 2.1 Task Creation
- The Project Manager must create a task for the Engineering Manager to assign an Engineer during project initiation.
- Accompany the task with an email to relevant stakeholders (e.g., Estimator, Sales Representative, Site Foreman).
- The Engineering Manager will respond with the assigned Engineer’s details within 24 hours.

### 2.2 Handoff Meeting
- Required attendees:
  - Project Manager
  - Sales Representative
  - Engineering Manager
  - Assigned Project Engineer
- Objectives:
  - Review project details.
  - Define engineering task(s) and timelines.
  - Allow the Project Engineer to provide input and recommendations.

### 2.3 Coordination and Execution
- Engineering team members follow the outlined plan from the handoff meeting.
- Address unplanned obstacles through coordination.
- Project Managers must make the assigned Project Engineer aware of the schedule for all engineering tasks and related milestones.
- General timeline guidance (varies by project):
  - Commissioning, Factory Acceptance Testing, and Programming: typically about 1 week; coordinate at handoff and adjust as the project progresses.

### 2.4 Progress Communication
- Engineering team members must email the Project Manager and Engineering Manager with updates; daily updates are preferred.

### 2.5 Line-item Changes
- Any line-item changes required by Engineering must be sent to the PM via the standardized Add/Delete Sheet (Excel).

### 2.6 PR Requests
- Standard turnaround time is 1 week but actual timing should be coordinated with the PM on a case-by-case basis when the PM tasks Engineering.

## 3. Service

When engineering services are required for service work:

### 3.1 Task Assignment
- Tasks can be directly assigned to the desired Engineering team member.
- For unresolved issues, the Service Manager may request the Engineering Manager’s involvement.

### 3.2 Recommendations
- The Service Manager can ask the Engineering Manager to recommend a suitable team member for assignment if needed.
