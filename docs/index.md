# Welcome to the AV Engineering Playbook

Below is the current Simplified SOPs for the Engineering Department

1. Opportunities

When engineering services are requested for an opportunity, the following steps must be followed:

1.1 Refer to Sales Funnel Process

· When creating the Design/Engineer funnel item be sure to include

o Clear directive of what the task is for Engineering to accomplish.

o Deadline for results to be delivered back to sales.

o Resources to complete the task (drawings and Specifications)

1.2 Engineering Manager Task Review

· The Engineering Manager will review funnel item tasks before assigning them to a team member to complete. Review to be completed within 24 hours.

1.3 Engineering Manager Results Review

· The Engineering Manager will review the results from the assigned team members and pass them on to the Sales Representative if they pass the review. Review to be completed within 24 hours

1.4 Turnaround Time

· Standard Time: 1 week for Opportunity item tasks.

· Expedited Requests: Sales Representatives must coordinate with the Engineering Manager before assigning items requiring shorter deadlines.

· Extended Timelines: Written request for extended timelines is not required.

2. Projects

When engineering services are required for a project, the following steps must be taken:

2.1 Task Creation

· The Project Manager must create a task for the Engineering Manager to assign an Engineer during project initiation.

· Accompany the task with an email to relevant stakeholders (e.g., Estimator, Sales Representative, Site Foreman).

· Engineering Manager will respond with the assigned Engineer’s details within 24 hours.

2.2 Handoff Meeting

· A handoff meeting must be conducted involving:

o Project Manager

o Sales Representative

o Engineering Manager

o Assigned Project Engineer

· Objectives:

o Review project details.

o Define Engineering task(s) and timelines.

o Allow the Project Engineer to provide input and recommendations.

2.3 Coordination and Execution

· Engineering team members follow the outlined plan from the handoff meeting.

· Address unplanned obstacles through coordination.

· Project Managers need to make the assigned Project Engineer aware of schedule for all Engineering tasks and related Milestones. General timeline for things like Commissioning, Factory Acceptance Testing and Programming is 1 week though this will vary wildly from project to project and should be coordinated at Handoff and adjusted as the project progresses.

2.4 Progress Communication

· Engineering team members must email the Project Manager and Engineering Manager with updates on their efforts. Daily is preferred.

2.5 Line-item Changes

· Any line-item changes required by Engineering need to be sent to PM via standardized Add Delete Sheet excel.

2.6 PR Requests

· standardized turnaround time is 1 week but appropriate turn-around time to be coordinated with PM on a case-by-case basis at time of tasking from PM.

3. Service

When engineering services are required for service work:

3.1 Task Assignment

· Tasks can be directly assigned to the desired Engineering team member.

· For unresolved issues, the Service Manager may request the Engineering Manager’s involvement.

3.2 Recommendations

· The Service Manager can ask the Engineering Manager to recommend a suitable team member for assignment if needed.
